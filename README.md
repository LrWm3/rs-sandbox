# Rust Sandbox

This is a sandbox for experimenting with Rust code and libraries.

## Creating a New Idea

To create a new idea, use the following command:

```bash
cargo new crates/your_new_idea --bin   # or --lib
```

## Building

To build and run the project, use:

```bash
cargo build
```

## Testing

```bash
cargo test
```

## Running

See individual crate directories for specific run commands; generally speaking
there are no specific run commands as tests drive the majority of the test cuts.
